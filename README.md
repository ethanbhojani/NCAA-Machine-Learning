Predicting match outcomes of the NCAA 2019 Men's Basketball Tournament through the Kaggle Competition.

The R file included in the repository contains the data cleaning, feature engineering, model creation, and testing. I have built different models, including RandomForests and GLM's, each using different amounts of different data types. 

*Created by Ethan Bhojani. Data through the Kaggle 2019 Men's Championship as well as collecting data from Sports Reference. Coded in R through RStudio*
